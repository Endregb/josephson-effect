# josephson-effect
Numerical simulation of the Josephson effect by solving the Usadel equations in a normal metal sandwiched between two superconductors. The project involves solving boundary value problems with custom and built-in solvers, analyzing the proximity effect, and computing the supercurrent as a function of phase difference.
